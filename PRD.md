## Tax Advisor Application - Master Plan (V2)
 
### 1. Overview
A web-based platform for salaried individuals to analyze tax liabilities and receive personalized, AI-powered tax-saving strategies. Users upload their salary slip or Form 16, review/enter data, compare tax regimes, and get actionable investment advice from Gemini.
 
### 2. Target Audience
- **Primary Users:** Salaried employees (India) with Pay Slips or Form 16.
- **Use Case:** Understand tax liabilities, optimize investments, and learn tax-saving techniques.
 
### 3. Core Features & User Flow
 
#### **Step 1: Landing Page**
- Modern, branded landing page with a "Start" button to begin the process.
 
#### **Step 2: PDF Upload & Data Extraction**
- User uploads a Pay Slip or Form 16 (PDF).
- The backend extracts data using a combination of `PyPDF2`, `pytesseract` (for OCR), and the `Gemini` LLM for structuring the data.
- The user is presented with a form pre-filled with the extracted data for review and editing.
- The user selects their preferred tax regime (Old/New) via a radio button.
 
#### **Step 3: Tax Calculation & Comparison**
- The backend calculates the tax liability for both regimes based on the verified data.
- Results are displayed in two visually distinct cards (Old vs. New Regime), with the user's selected regime highlighted.
- The financial data is saved to the Supabase database with a unique session ID.
 
#### **Step 4: AI-Powered Advisor (Gemini)**
- Based on the user's data, Gemini proactively asks a smart, contextual follow-up question.
- After the user answers, Gemini provides personalized, actionable investment and tax-saving suggestions in a modern, readable card format.

| `deduction_80d` | `NUMERIC(15, 2)` | 80D medical insurance |
| `standard_deduction` | `NUMERIC(15, 2)` | Standard deduction |
| `professional_tax` | `NUMERIC(15, 2)` | Professional tax paid |
| `tds` | `NUMERIC(15, 2)` | Tax Deducted at Source |
| `created_at` | `TIMESTAMPTZ` | Record creation timestamp |
 
### 6. UI/UX Principles
